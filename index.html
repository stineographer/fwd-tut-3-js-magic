      You've found it!

    <!--
      So, you've discovered html comments!
      Excellent work.
      Now you'll be able to read
      my explanations about
      other html tags.

      At the top of this file
      is a bunch of other tags:
       DOCTYPE,
       the html tag itself,
       a head tag,
      the title tag,
       and a few meta tags.
      For the most part, we're going to leave these tags in
      and ignore them.
      These tags give a browser
      general information about
      how to interpret the following markup language.

      The only element in this section of the file
      that we'll change is the "title"
      element.

      It begins like this:
      <title>

      and ends like this:
      </title>

      Any text you put inside
      the title tag
      will appear in the name of the tab
      where your html is displayed.

      When you first open this html file,
      the content of the title tag
      should be:
      "fwd-tut-3".
      Feel free to change
      the content of this tag in any way you see fit!
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css" />
        <!-- import the webpage's stylesheet

           The style.css file is where we can
           change numerous details about
           how a particular section
           of our page is visually displayed.

           Head on over to that file if
           you feel like skipping ahead to
           sizes, colours, and fonts
           (oh my!).

           We list this file here,
           in a special "link" tag
           that tells a browser
           where the styles for this web page are.
          -->

     <!-- import the webpage's javascript file -->
    <script src="/index.js" defer></script>

  </head>
   <!--
      Directly above, you'll see the closing tag
      for the "head" section of this html file.
      This is the end of a section that contains
      tags specifying how a browser is to interpret
      the following html.
    -->

  <!--
      Directly below, you'll see an opening tag
      for the "body" section of this html file.

      The body of an html file is
      where all the content of a page will be displayed.

      This is where you'll start writing
      your list poem!
    -->
  <body>

    <!--

     In html, there are 6 sizes for a heading.
     When you're thinking of a heading
      picture what you'd see on the front page of a magazine,
     or a tabloid newspaper.

    A heading is always going to be
    an attention grabber,
     so use them wisely.
    They go from largest to smallest
    starting with
    <h1>
    to
    <h6>.

    Remember, most html requires
    an opening
    and a closing
    tag!
    -->
    <h1>
      whispering-descriptive-pump

    <!--
      That's our opening <h1> tag!
      Any text we put inside here
      has the largest heading size.
    -->
    </h1>
      <!--
      That's our </h1> closing  tag!
      Any text we put inside here
      has the largest heading size.
    -->

    <h6>
        <!--
      This is an example of smallest heading size.

    <!--
      The following html uses the concept of an
      Ordered List.
      This time, our list items
      have a number and an order.
      By default,
      the order is always: 1, 2, 3...

      It's possible to change this default style,
      but you'll need a little extra help for that:

    <ol id="ordered-list" start="0" class="log">

          -including how these concepts can be used in JavaScript
