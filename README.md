TUTORIAL #3
=================

    SEQUENTIAL (Also Known As 
    a Linear) SEARCH ALGORITHM: sorted list
    -we're stepping away from lines of poetry for a moment
    -we'll temporarily trade them in for an array of phone numbers 
    I know that's not a great trade, 
    but it'll help us to discuss our 
    first major algorithm in computer science:
    the SEQUENTIAL (Linear) SEARCH!
    -dunh-dunh-dunh!
    
    -there's even an entire wikipedia article dedicated to 
    this particular topic, and we're about to take a deep dive into it:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search
    
    -since this is our first major algorithm,
    and computer science is the study of algorithms
    I think it's important that we get this right
    
    In tutorial #3, we'll focus specifically on the algorithm
    for a sorted list, referered to in that wikipedia article
    as 'an ordered table'.
    We're going to consider a worst case scenario,
    where it's discovered that 
    the target value you're searching for 
    is not in your sorted list. 
    
    It's important to remember that an algorithm
    isn't specific to any one programming language.
    Algorithms are supposed to be language agnostic
    that way. 
  
    What I've written in JavaScript is one way to 
    implement the algorithms described in the 
    linear search wikipedia article.
    I'm attempting to show you an algorithm
    that doesn't require some of the steps
    described here:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search#In_an_ordered_table 
    
    -often the (somewhat antiquated) example
    of a linear search algorithm
    is looking up someone's number in a phone book 

    -with that in mind, we'll start by considering
    the above algorithm
    
    -lets get to the code!

### ← README.md

That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

### ← index.html

This is where your HTML lives!

### ← style.css

CSS files add styling rules to your content.

### ← script.js

As Glitch says, "If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript."
